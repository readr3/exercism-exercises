# Raindrops

Write a program that converts a number to a string, the contents of which depends on the number's prime factors.

If the number contains 3 as a prime factor, output 'Pling'.
If the number contains 5 as a prime factor, output 'Plang'.
If the number contains 7 as a prime factor, output 'Plong'.

If the number does not contain 3, 5, or 7 as a prime factor, simply return the
string representation of the number itself.

E.g.

The prime factors of 28 are [2, 2, 7].

```ruby
drops = Raindrops.new.convert(28)
# => "Plong"
```

The prime factors of 1755 are [3, 3, 3, 5, 13].

```ruby
drops = Raindrops.new.convert(1755)
# => "PlingPlang"
```

The prime factors of 34 are [2, 17].

```ruby
drops = Raindrops.new.convert(34)
# => "34"
```
